## MLJBase

The model interface for
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), a Julia
machine learning framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJBase.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJBase.jl)

MLJ is a Julia framework for combining and tuning machine learning
models. Any machine learning algorithms written in Julia can be used
with MLJ if it is defined in a package that imports the MLJBase
module, and implements the model API defined there. For more
information, see the MLJ document ["Implementing the MLJ interface for
a learning
algorithm"](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/doc/adding_models_for_general_use.md).

Requires at least Julia v1.0.

For MLJ documentation refer to the
[MLJ repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl).
